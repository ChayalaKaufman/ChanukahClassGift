Hi!
Welcome to the ChanukahClassGift App.
This app was created to help class mothers organize a Chanukah gift for their children's teachers.
It's purpose is to keep track of who contributed and who didn't yet, and who was called or emailed, and who wasn't.
Below I will explain how the app works.
The main page has a table that displays the whole class list, with the parent and contact information.
The students are added to the table by clicking on the 'Add Student' button on the top of the page.
On the table, there are additional columns.
  -Contribution: displays the contribution amount that the student gave. If the student hasn't yet contributed, it displays a textbox and
  submit button to add their contribution when they give one.
 The next few columns are only available if the student has not yet contributed.
  -Send Automatic Email: send a scripted email asking the parent for a contribution.
  -Record Calls/Email: opens a form where you can log the calls/emails you've made for that specific student. You can enter notes as well
  e.g. "left a message on their machine". When it is saved to the database, it will record the date as well.
  -View Calls/Emails: shows you all the calls and emails that you've made for that student.
  **Being that having an email address is optional (as it says on the add-student-form), the automatic email link will not show up if
  there is no email for that student.
Above the table there is a display of the total money collected.
You can also set the view of the table to your preference, using the buttons: view all, view paid, and view unpaid. 
I hope you find everything clear and user-friendly!
